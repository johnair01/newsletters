"""The ``Problem`` lifecycle entity — a first-class record ABOVE ``Source`` (PROB-01).

A ``Problem`` makes the scattered ``problem -> owned -> solution -> verified`` lifecycle a
legible, evidence-traced home — **a legibility layer, NOT a second tracker**. Problem-*solving*
stays external/operator-owned; this module models only the *record* of the lifecycle and never
executes it.

IMPORT-GRAPH NOTE (load-bearing — the leaf/acyclic rule): this module imports ONLY stdlib +
pydantic + ``.semantic`` (``Source``, ``Trace`` — the spine's evidence types). It must NEVER
import the AI/``distill`` package, ``capture``, ``render``, ``site``, or any network/external-
system package. It sits one tier ABOVE the leaf (``locators.py``): the edge is

    problem -> semantic -> {locators, templates}

which is acyclic — ``semantic.py`` imports only ``.locators`` + ``.templates`` and NEVER imports
``problem`` (the dependency is strictly one-way). This mirrors how ``promote.py`` imports from
``.semantic`` (the import-pattern precedent) while staying AI-free.

Three invariants are enforced *in code*:

1. **Every Problem traces to evidence** — a Problem aggregates ``>=1`` ``Trace`` to its
   constituent ``Source`` records (the scattered ticket / passdown / RCA). A Problem with zero
   sources is refused at construction (it is not legible).
2. **Human-gated, never auto-mutated** — state changes ONLY through ``transition(to, by, ...)``,
   which refuses a transition with no recorded actor. There is no public setter and no
   auto-advance path. This mirrors the no-auto-publish gate in ``semantic.py``.
3. **Ladder-enforced** — ``transition`` refuses an illegal ladder move (a skip, or an arbitrary
   backward jump); only sequential-forward moves plus the two explicit re-open edges
   (Resolved/Verified -> In Progress) are allowed. The lifecycle's bumps are *recorded*, never
   erased.

The verb is ``transition`` (NOT promote / publish / advance / fan-out / derive — the three-axis
terminology guard reserves those for the review gate and the fan-out chain).
