"""MODA-01 — the synthetic ``module`` corpus builder (Phase 3).

This module is the worked-example half of MODA-01: it composes and renders the committed
synthetic ``content/module/module-a.yml`` config end-to-end (loader → composer → ledger →
render → Library) into a self-contained ``content/module/`` corpus with its OWN append-only
ledger. It is deliberately a THIN seam that MIRRORS :mod:`newsletters.worksurface` exactly —
``Ledger.load`` → ``Site.from_surfaces`` → ``ledger.save()`` → ``render_surface`` per page →
``render_library`` → self-hosted fonts — reusing the Phase-1 loader, the Phase-2 composer, and
the Phase-9/10 render devices with ZERO edits to any existing module.

WHY a new top-level module (a sibling of ``worksurface.py``, not code in ``compose.py``):
``compose.py`` is a LEAF (COMP contract: it must not import ``render``/``site``), so the
build-and-render seam cannot live there. Like ``worksurface.build_work_site``, this is a plain
corpus builder that wires the loader/composer to the renderer over a committed, hand-authored
config — the honest fit is a sibling builder module, not a fork of the renderer.

The four-property contract (mirrors ``worksurface.py`` / ``swimlane.py`` / ``compose.py``):

* READ-ONLY / NO NETWORK. The only writes are the ledger + the rendered output the caller asked
  for; no network call anywhere (the fonts are self-hosted via the reused ``_emit_fonts``).
* CONTENT-ADDRESSED / FAITHFUL. Every rendered claim is content-addressed by the loader and the
  owner quote is emitted via the SOURCED path only (a traced claim selected from the load) —
  never fabricated; the honesty panel shows every disclosed gap.
* DETERMINISTIC / BYTE-STABLE. Relies wholly on the loader/composer's ``EPOCH_ZERO`` + file
  order and the append-only ledger — no ``datetime.now()``, no ``set()``, no non-total sort — so
  the committed output equals a fresh build (SITE-06 extended to the module corpus).
* AI-FREE / MINIMAL-CORE. Imports only stdlib + sibling core modules (``swimlane``, ``compose``,
  ``site``, ``render``, ``worksurface`` for the shared ``_emit_fonts``) and the lazy
  ``_yaml_loader`` boundary. NO ``yaml`` at module top level, NO AI package — importable on a
  bare, no-extras install.
